O[1] = costant time
O[n] = linear time
O[n2] = n * n quadratic time
O[log n] = Logirathmic time

constant time
example 
a+b

even if input is big or small going to take constant time(not based on input)


linear time
O[n] - time changes based on given input

example: for loop



you can ignore the constant ie O[1]

2 diff input O[n*m]

O[3n^2] = O[n^2] ---> Quadratic time
